# aim_screennames
Simple to python application get screennames from aim.com

original idea came from http://dangoldin.com/2017/10/09/downloading-your-aim-buddy-list/

i modified the original code to include the actually screen name and not their context name(display name) under the file aim_get_sn.js

when you successfully run the code in your console and went through all the screen names, right click and save the console log.

this program will parse out the parts between screen names and schools and save a list of only the screen names

currently working on a 2nd phase which will parse out the persons aim name along with their screen name
