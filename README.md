# aim_screennames
Simple to python application get screennames from aim.com

original idea came from http://dangoldin.com/2017/10/09/downloading-your-aim-buddy-list/

i modified the original code to include the actually screen name and not their context name(display name) under the file aim_get_sn.js

when you successfully run the code in your console and have gone through all the screen names, right click and save the console log.

this program will parse out the parts between each screen names and save to a seperate file, a list of only the screen names

currently working on a 2nd phase which will parse out the persons aim name along with their screen name

i have added the aim_get_sn_n_display.js to extract screen name along with display name from aim.com
